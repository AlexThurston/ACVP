1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing RSA
   akgorithm implementations for conformance to [FIPS186-4] using ACVP.
   See also [RSA2VS].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Testing scope

   The ACVP testing for RSA allows conformance testing for the three
   modes of using the algorithm as specified in [FIPS186-4]: key
   generation, signature generation and signature verification.
   Correspondingly, ACVP allows testing of the five different methods
   for key generation in [FIPS186-4], Appendix B.3.

   ACVP also allows testing of legacy RSA implementations in the
   signature verification mode according to [FIPS186-2].

2.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires cryptographic modules to register their capabilities.
   This allows the cryptographic module to advertise support for
   specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need
   test vectors generated for the validation process.  This section
   describes the constructs for advertising support of the RSA algorithm
   in all allowed modes to the ACVP server - see [FIPS186-4] for
   details.

2.1.  Supported RSA Algorithm modes

   The following RSA algorithm modes may be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant crypto module:

                +----------------------+-----------------+
                | JSON algorithm value | JSON mode value |
                +----------------------+-----------------+
                | RSA                  | keyGen          |
                |                      | sigGen          |
                |                      | sigVer          |
                |                      | legacySigVer    |
                +----------------------+-----------------+

2.2.  Supported RSA Capabilities

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an

   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each RSA algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.  The following JSON values are used for
   RSA algorithm capabilities:

   RSA mode defined in this section.  The 'modeSpecs' value is part of
   the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration
   message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the registration
   message.

               Table 5: RSA keyGen Capabilities JSON Values

2.3.2.  The sigGen Mode Capabilities

   The RSA sigGen mode capabilities are advertised as an array of JSON
   objects within the array of 'modeSpecs' value of the ACVP
   registration message. as part of the 'capability_exchange' element of
   the ACVP JSON registration message.  See the ACVP specification for
   details on the registration message.

   Each RSA sigGen mode capability is advertised as a self-contained
   JSON object.

2.3.3.  The sigVer Mode Capabilities

   The RSA sigVer mode capabilities are advertised as an array of JSON
   objects within the array of 'modeSpecs' value of the ACVP
   registration message. as part of the 'capability_exchange' element of
   the ACVP JSON registration message.  See the ACVP specification for
   details on the registration message.

   Each RSA sigVer mode capability is advertised as a self-contained
   JSON object.

2.3.4.  The legacySigVer Mode Capabilities

   The RSA legacySigVer mode capabilities are advertised as an array of
   JSON objects within the array of 'modeSpecs' value of the ACVP
   registration message. as part of the 'capability_exchange' element of
   the ACVP JSON registration message.  See the ACVP specification for
   details on the registration message.

   Each RSA legacySigVer mode capability is advertised as a self-
   contained JSON object.

3.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual algorithm, such as Hash_DRBG,
   etc.  This section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set
   used with DRBG algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

   +-------------+---------------------------------------------+-------+

   +-------------+---------------------------------------------+-------+

                      Table 6: Vector Set JSON Object

3.1.  Test Groups JSON Schema

   The test_groups element at the top level in the test vector JSON
   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the
   vector set.  For instance, all test vectors that use the same key
   size would be grouped together.  The Test Group JSON object contains
   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The
   following table describes the DRBG JSON elements of the Test Group
   JSON object.

   ACVP allows default bit lengths for the inputs to specific
   algorithms, typically communicated as numerical value zero (0).  If
   an implementation does not support one of the defaults, the bit
   lengths the supported values shall be specified explicitly.

   elements for each DRBG test vector.
