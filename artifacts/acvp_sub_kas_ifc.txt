1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing KAS IFC
   algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

2.  Test Types and Test Coverage

   The ACVP server performs a set of tests on the KAS protocol in order
   to assess the correctness and robustness of the implementation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session SHALL require multiple tests to be
   performed for every supported permutation of KAS capabilities.  This
   section describes the design of the tests used to validate
   implementations of KAS algorithms.  There are two test types for KAS
   testing:

      "AFT" - Algorithm Function Test.  In the AFT test mode, the IUT
      SHALL act as a party in the Key Agreement with the ACVP server.
      The server SHALL generate and provide all necessary information
      for the IUT to perform a successful key agreement; both the server
      and IUT MAY act as party U/V, as well as recipient/provider to key
      confirmation.

      "VAL" - Validation test.  In the VAL test mode, The ACVP server
      MUST generate a complete (from both party U and party V's
      perspectives) key agreement, and expects the IUT to be able to
      determine if that agreement is valid.  Various types of errors
      MSUT be introduced in varying portions of the key agreement
      process (changed DKM, changed key, changed hash digest, etc), that
      the IUT MUST be able to detect and report on.

2.1.  Test Coverage

   The tests described in this document have the intention of ensuring
   an implementation is conformant to [SP800-56Br2] .

2.1.1.  KAS-IFC Requirements Covered

      SP 800-56Br2 - 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions.  SHA1, SHA2, and
      SHA3 hash functions SHALL be available for the various pieces of
      KAS/KTS requiring use of a hash function.

      SP 800-56Br2 - 5.2 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Algorithms.
      AES-CMAC, HMAC, and KMAC algorithms SHALL be available for testing
      under KDFs and KC as the specification states.

      SP 800-56Br2 - 5.3 Random Bit Generators.  Though random values

      SP 800-56Br2 - 7 Primitives and Operations.  All primitives (save
      the previously mentioned RBG) SHALL be in the scope of the ACVP
      server testing.  There are several situations where errors MAY be
      injected into varying portions of inputs for these primitives, the
      IUT is expected to be able to detect these errors.

      SP 800-56Br2 - 5.4 Nonces.  Though nonces are used, the testing of
      the construction of those nonces SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP
      testing.

      SP 800-56Br2 - 5.5.2.1.2 The ASN.1 Format for FixedInfo.  The ACVP

      algorithms SHALL NOT be in scope of ACVP testing, though the ACVP
      server SHALL support all indicated Hash and MAC functions.

3.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP REQUIRES crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes
   the constructs for advertising support of KAS IFC algorithms to the
   ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The

Internet-Draft                Sym Alg JSON                  October 2019


   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each KDF algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.

3.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for KAS IFC Validations

   Some algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, IKEv2 uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

3.4.1.4.  FixedInfoPatternConstruction

   IUTs SHALL be capable of specifying how the FixedInfo is constructed
   for the KAS/KTS negotiation.

   Pattern candidates:

   o  literal[123456789ABCDEF]

      *  uses the specified hex within "[]". literal[123456789ABCDEF]
         substitutes "123456789ABCDEF" in place of the field

   o  uPartyInfo

      *  uPartyId { || dkmNonce } { || c }

   o  vPartyInfo

      *  vPartyId { || dkmNonce } { || c }

   o  context

      *  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the context.

   o  algorithmId

      *  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the
         algorithmId.

   o  label

      *  Random value chosen by ACVP server to represent the label.

   Example (Note that party U is the server in this case "434156536964",
   party V is the IUT "a1b2c3d4e5"):

   o  "concatenation" :
      "literal[123456789CAFECAFE]||uPartyInfo||vPartyInfo"

   Evaluated as:

   o  "123456789CAFECAFE434156536964a1b2c3d4e5"

3.4.1.5.  Supported MAC Methods

   Note that AT LEAST one mac method must be supplied when making use of
   Key Confirmation.
