1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing RSA
   akgorithm implementations for conformance to [FIPS186-4] using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Testing scope

   The ACVP testing for RSA allows conformance testing for the three
   modes of using the algorithm as specified in [FIPS186-4]: key
   generation, signature generation and signature verification.
   Correspondingly, ACVP allows testing of the five different methods
   for key generation in [FIPS186-4], Appendix B.3.

   ACVP also allows testing of legacy RSA implementations in the
   signature verification mode according to [FIPS186-2].

2.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires cryptographic modules to register their capabilities.
   This allows the cryptographic module to advertise support for
   specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need
   test vectors generated for the validation process.  This section
   describes the constructs for advertising support of the RSA algorithm
   in all allowed modes to the ACVP server - see [FIPS186-4] for
   details.

2.1.  Supported RSA Algorithm modes

   The following RSA algorithm modes may be advertised by the ACVP
   compliant crypto module:

                +----------------------+-----------------+
                | JSON algorithm value | JSON mode value |
                +----------------------+-----------------+
                | RSA                  | keyGen          |
                |                      | sigGen          |
                |                      | sigVer          |
                |                      | legacySigVer    |
                +----------------------+-----------------+

            Table 1: Supported RSA Algorithm Modes JSON Values

2.2.  Supported RSA Capabilities

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each RSA algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.  The following JSON values are used for
   RSA algorithm capabilities:

3.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual algorithm, such as Hash_DRBG,
   etc.  This section describes the JSON schema for a test vector set
   used with DRBG algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.  The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.
