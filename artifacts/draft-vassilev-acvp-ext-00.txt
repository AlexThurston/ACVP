1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification outlines the procedure for adding support for
   testing a new algorithm.

3.  Adding a new algorithm to an existing class

   To add testing for a new algorithm first confirm that the class the
   new algorithm belongs to exists within the taxonomy shown in
   Section 2.

3.1.  Adding a new algorithm with existing test types

   If it belongs to an already-suppoted class, check if it is similar to
   some of the already supported algorithms from that class.  Typically,
   the algorithms in a given class share similar testing methodology.

   For example, the testing of symmetric block ciphers is comprised of
   two test types: Algorithm Functional Tests and Monte Carlo Tests -
   see [sub-symmetric].

   Assuming that the existing test types cover well the new algorithm,
   one needs to add the new block cipher algorithm to the symmertic
   block cipher specification [sub-symmetric], including the name,
   configuration parameters, registration capabilities, schemas for the
   corresponding test data exchanges between the validation server and
   the client.  See in particular Section "Adding new algorithms" in the
   corresponding algorithm specification.

   Once this is completed and the corresponding server test generation
   and validation for that algorithm is implemented, testing can

   commence.  Clients implementing that algorithm may register it for
   testing as described in Section "Capabilities Registration" in
   [sub-symmetric], process the test vectors generated by the validation
   server and return the results for validation.

3.2.  Adding a new test type to a new or existing algorithm

   If the available test types for an algorithm, existing or new, in a
   given class do not cover well the testing of the algorithm, one could
   develop a new test type and incorporate it into the corresponding
   test specification for the existing class.  See for example
   Section "Adding new algorithms" in [sub-symmetric] for how to add a
   new test type.

4.  Adding a new algorithm to a new class

   TBD.

5.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD...

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are addressed by the ACVP specification.
